    </div>

    <p>
        Every great idea begins with a moment of inspiration. For us, it was a realization —
        a realization that despite Pakistan’s rich literary and poetic history, there wasn’t a
        digital space truly dedicated to our vibrant poet community. Bayaan was born from that spark.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">The Beginning</h2>

    <p>
        As developers and poetry enthusiasts, we often saw scattered verses on social media,
        WhatsApp statuses, and old paper diaries. These were beautiful, heartfelt, and raw —
        but they lacked a permanent home. A place where poets, especially emerging ones,
        could publish, preserve, and share their voice in a respectful and welcoming digital mehfil.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Our Focus: The Pakistani Poet Community</h2>

    <p>
        From Faiz Ahmed Faiz to Parveen Shakir, Pakistan has nurtured legendary voices. But where
        was the next generation publishing their work? Most platforms were too generic or non-local.
        We chose to focus on Pakistani poets — from Lahore to Larkana — to give them a space
        where their cultural essence, native language, and poetic form could shine.
    </p>

    <p>
        That’s why Bayaan supports not just ghazals and nazms but also allows users to write in Urdu,
        Roman Urdu, and even regional languages. We believe in celebrating our diversity through
        the rhythm of words.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">More Than Just Publishing</h2>

    <p>
        Bayaan isn’t just a blog or poetry repository — it’s a community. Poets can submit their
        profiles, readers can browse and appreciate poetry, and everyone can feel a little more
        connected to the soul of Pakistan.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ve also worked hard on creating a system where genuine talent can shine. Through our
        approval process, we aim to maintain quality while being inclusive and supportive of new voices.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Where We’re Headed</h2>

    <p>
        This is just the beginning. Bayaan is a living platform. Soon, we’ll be introducing features
        like audio poetry, poet interviews, virtual mehfils, and collaborative writing spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our dream is to become a digital home for every Pakistani who loves poetry — whether
        they write it, read it, or simply feel it.
